# This is a board game worth playing with a group of 2+ people!
#### Instructions include splitting up in two teams (Red and Blue),
#### Each team will then choose their Spymaster to view the special color coded card to lead your team to victory (only one spymaster per team)
#### Spymasters, you have 2 jobs: one is selecting 1 word as a clue and second is stating the number of how many cards this clue is for on the board (Example: Car, 2; words on the board would be "trunk" and "tire") but make sure to choose your word wisely, as you do not want to accidentally give the other team points, or worse... uncover the assassination card (your team automatically loses if this card is chosen and it ends the game. This tretorous card is identified as the black/gray one on the spymaster card, in which only the spymasters will know and avoid at all costs).
